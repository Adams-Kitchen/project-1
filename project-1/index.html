            <h1> Josef Stalin: The "Man of Steel"</h1>
            <h2>The Ruthless Leader and the Legacy he Left Behind</h2>
            <p>Josef Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili, 1878–1953) was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. 
                Stalin rose to power after the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924, consolidating his rule through brutal political purges, 
                repression, and control over the Communist Party. Under his leadership, the USSR transitioned 
                from an agrarian society to an industrial superpower through rapid industrialization and forced collectivization of agriculture. 
                However, these policies led to widespread famine, notably the Holodomor in Ukraine, and millions of deaths.</p>
            <p>Stalin's rule was characterized by a cult of personality, with propaganda and censorship used to maintain his image as a strong and infallible leader. </p>
            <p>Stalin is best known for his Great Purge (1936–1938), during which he 
                eliminated perceived enemies through imprisonment, exile, and execution. His regime was 
                characterized by extreme authoritarianism, widespread surveillance, and political repression. </p>
            <p>After his death in 1953, Stalin's legacy remained controversial, with some viewing him as a hero who modernized the Soviet Union and defeated fascism, 
                while others see him as a <i><b>ruthless</b></i> dictator responsible for the deaths of <i><b>millions</b></i> of people. </p>
